# Segmentation on multi-vendor MRI images

This is the source code for my MSc thesis.

The aim of the thesis was to train a robust U-Net model, which is able to do segmentatation on MRI images made by previously unseen MRI scanners, without major accuracy decrease.


I implemented a U-Net model and trained it with domain adversarial learning(https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.07818.pdf).

Additional information from the used data can be found in the data_sources.md file.
